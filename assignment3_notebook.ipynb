    "We took some inspiration from Enrico’s lecture codes and posted materials. We used Gemini to typeset formulas and Copilot to improve grammar and clarity, as English is our second language. We also aimed to keep the notebook as short as possible, following the project description: “The shorter the Jupyter notebook in terms of number of lines, the more bonus points you will get (up to 5 points). Comments and assert statements do not count in the line numbers.”\n",

    "In this project, we use Monte Carlo simulation methods to calculate the volume of a DNA molecule. We develop and test our approach by first working with simple spherical shapes, then extend the method to handle complex molecular structures. For simple spheres, we generate random points in a 3D simulation box and check if each point falls inside or outside the sphere. The fraction of points inside the sphere gives us an estimate of the sphere's volume. We validate our method by calculating pi and comparing our results with the known value. We then apply this method to calculate DNA volume by treating each atom in the DNA molecule as a sphere with a specific position and van der Waals radius obtained from the periodic table. Our results show that Monte Carlo simulation can accurately estimate volumes when we use enough random sample points. We also explore a random walk approach to calculate the accessible volume around the DNA molecule. The results support the idea that Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for solving complex geometry problems in molecular biology. We discuss the accuracy of our methods, sources of error, and possible improvements for future work.\n"

    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods use random sampling to solve mathematical problems [1,2]. These methods are named after the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco because they rely on randomness, similar to casino games [3]. The modern version of Monte Carlo simulation was developed by scientists Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann in the 1940s during work on nuclear weapons [2,4]. Today, scientists use Monte Carlo methods in physics, chemistry, and biology to solve difficult problems that are hard to solve with normal mathematical equations [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we use Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the volume of a DNA molecule. DNA is the molecule that carries genetic information in living organisms [6]. It has a double helix structure, which looks like a twisted ladder [7]. DNA is made of atoms like hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus [8]. The project has two main parts. In the first part, we use Monte Carlo methods to estimate volumes. We do this by creating many random points in a 3D space and checking if each point is inside or outside a shape [2,5]. We start with simple spheres to test our method. Then we work with real DNA data, where we treat each atom as a small sphere with a specific position and size taken from the periodic table. The size of each atom is given by its van der Waals radius, which describes how close atoms can get to each other [9,10].\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part uses a different method called random walk. This method helps us calculate the accessible volume around the DNA molecule. Accessible volume means the empty space where other molecules can move around the DNA. This is important for understanding how molecules interact in biological systems [11].\n",
    "\n",
    "During this project, we will create Python functions and classes to do these calculations. We will check if our methods give correct results and make plots to show our findings. We will put all our functions in a .py file and use them in a Jupyter notebook to solve the DNA volume problem. Finally, we will present our results, discuss what works well and what could be improved, and share what we learned from this project.\n"

    "### Task 2: Make a fast function to generate a set of random walkers in 3D starting from a set of different random points\n",
    "\n",
    "The looped (Task 1) walker is slow—one walker, one step at a time in Python. For accessible volume we need many walkers and many steps, so we switch to NumPy vectorization [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "**The vectorization approach:**\n",
    "Instead of loops, we use NumPy arrays to process all walkers and steps simultaneously. This is called vectorization and is much faster because:\n",
    "- NumPy operations run in compiled C code (not Python)\n",
    "- All walkers move in parallel (no loop overhead)\n",
    "- Memory access is optimized [5]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:** We created a `fast_random_walk_3d` function that:\n",
    "1. Takes number of walkers, steps, starting positions, and step size\n",
    "2. Generates ALL random directions at once (shape: n_walkers × n_steps × 3)\n",
    "3. Randomly chooses from 6 unit directions: [±1,0,0], [0,±1,0], [0,0,±1]\n",
    "4. Computes cumulative positions using `np.cumsum` (vectorized)\n",
    "5. Returns array of shape (n_walkers, n_steps+1, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance test:**\n",
    "- **Configuration:** 100 walkers, 1,000 steps each = 100,000 total steps\n",
    "- **Time:** 0.055 seconds\n",
    "- **Speed:** 1,819,079 steps/second\n",
    "- **Output:** (100, 1001, 3) array - all trajectories computed at once\n",
    "\n",
    "**Speed comparison:**\n",
    "The vectorized version is approximately **100-1000× faster** than the loop-based version from Task 1. For example:\n",
    "- Loop version: ~100 steps/second (single walker)\n",
    "- Vectorized: ~1,800,000 steps/second (100 walkers simultaneously)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:**\n",
    "The 3D plot shows one example trajectory:\n",
    "- Green circle: starting position\n",
    "- Red square: ending position after 1,000 steps\n",
    "- Blue line: the random walk path\n",
    "\n",
    "The trajectory shows typical random walk behavior: irregular path exploring space near the starting point, with total displacement roughly proportional to √(number of steps) [5,8].\n",

    "\n",
    "**Test 1: Volume Conservation** ✓\n",
    "- Box volume: 35,216.17 Å³\n",
    "- DNA volume: 3,266 Å³\n",
    "- Accessible volume: ~31,950 Å³\n",
    "- Sum: ~35,216 Å³\n",
    "- Error: < 1% (within Monte Carlo uncertainty)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test 2: Statistical Consistency** ✓\n",
    "- Mean accessible volume: ~31,950 Å³\n",
    "- Standard deviation: ~30-40 Å³\n",
    "- CV: < 0.2% (excellent convergence)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test 3: Bounds Check** ✓\n",
    "- 0 < V_accessible (~31,950) < V_box (35,216) ✓\n",
    "- 0 < V_DNA (3,266) < V_box (35,216) ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Result:**\n",
    "$$V_{accessible} = 31,950 \\pm 35 \\text{ Å}^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical interpretation:**\n",
    "- **Accessible fraction:** 31,950 / 35,216 = 90.7%\n",
    "- **DNA occupies:** 3,266 / 35,216 = 9.3% of box volume\n",
    "- This makes sense: DNA is a linear molecule with lots of empty space around it [6,8]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verification summary:**\n",
    "✓ All tests passed\n",
    "✓ Volume conservation holds (within 0.5%)\n",
    "✓ Results are statistically stable (CV < 0.2%)\n",
    "✓ Physical bounds satisfied\n",
    "✓ Accessible volume is ~10× larger than DNA volume (physically reasonable)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison with Topic 1:**\n",
    "- **Topic 1:** Calculated DNA volume (~3,266 Å³) using Monte Carlo\n",
    "- **Topic 2:** Calculated accessible volume (~31,950 Å³) using Monte Carlo\n",
    "- **Consistency check:** DNA + Accessible = 3,266 + 31,950 = 35,216 Å³ = Box volume ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "The accessible volume is important for:\n",
    "1. **Molecular docking:** How much space is available for other molecules to interact with DNA [11]\n",
    "2. **Diffusion studies:** Understanding how molecules move around DNA [4,5,8]\n",
    "3. **Solvent accessibility:** Predicting which parts of DNA can interact with water and ions [6]\n",
    "4. **Drug design:** Finding where small molecules can bind to DNA [11]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success!** We have successfully calculated both the DNA volume (9.3% of box) and accessible volume (90.7% of box) using Monte Carlo methods. The two approaches (Topic 1 and Topic 2) give consistent, complementary results that sum to the total box volume [1,2,9,10]."

    "## Conclusion and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### What did we learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrated how Monte Carlo methods calculate volumes of complex molecular structures. Starting with simple spheres and progressing to real DNA data, we learned that random sampling can solve problems difficult or impossible to address with analytical equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "The hit-and-miss Monte Carlo method proved effective for complex geometry: generate random points, check if inside shapes, and calculate volume from the fraction inside. Error decreases as 1/√N, meaning quadrupling the sample size halves the error. For DNA with 259 atoms, we achieved accurate results (~3,266 Å³) with sufficient sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization provided dramatic performance improvements—from ~100 steps/second to ~1,800,000 steps/second, a 10,000× speedup. This demonstrated that algorithm design is crucial for scientific computing beyond mere correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Van der Waals radii proved essential for molecular volume calculations. Each atom type (H, C, N, O, P) has a specific radius, and DNA atoms overlap significantly (~11% in our calculation), which correctly reflects covalent bonding. The accessible volume (~31,950 Å³) was approximately 10× larger than DNA volume, showing DNA occupies only ~9% of the simulation box—revealing ample space for water, ions, and molecular interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world relevance**\n",
    "\n",
    "With real DNA coordinates, we transformed molecular data into useful measurements. These volumes inform understanding of molecular packing, drug binding, protein interactions, and molecular recognition. The method generalizes to any molecule—proteins, RNA, or drug compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model assumptions:** We assumed hard spheres with van der Waals radii, ignoring electron cloud distributions, solvent effects, electrostatics, and molecular flexibility. Real DNA bends and moves in solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter sensitivity:** Different radius tables give varying values, and a 10% change in radii can alter volume by ~30% (V ∝ r³). With 259 atoms and 200,000 sample points, we performed ~52 million distance checks—spatial partitioning algorithms could improve efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static structure:** We used a single DNA configuration, missing conformational flexibility that affects both DNA and accessible volumes. We verified results using volume conservation and convergence but lacked experimental validation from X-ray or NMR data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible improvements:**\n",
    "* Multiple DNA configurations from molecular dynamics for average volumes\n",
    "* Spatial indexing (octrees, k-d trees) for faster point-in-sphere checks\n",
    "* Explicit or implicit solvent models for solvation effects\n",
    "* Testing with multiple radius sets (Bondi, Alvarez, Cambridge)\n",
    "* Uncertainty quantification through bootstrap or Bayesian methods\n",
    "* 3D interactive visualization of DNA structure and accessible regions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broader perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple models are powerful yet limited. Monte Carlo can calculate volumes for any molecule, but real molecular interactions involve quantum mechanics, electrostatics, entropy, and dynamics. As with all models: some are useful, though none are perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project combined general mathematical tools with molecule-specific details, requiring both computational skills and chemical knowledge. Real drug discovery combines many methods—geometric calculations, molecular dynamics, quantum chemistry, and experiments—not Monte Carlo alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "The progression from simple spheres to DNA made Monte Carlo intuitive while reminding us that behind each coordinate lies a complex molecule essential for life. We witnessed computational progress through vectorization but recognized challenges remain: large proteins have thousands of atoms requiring better force fields and sampling methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skills practiced here—implementing algorithms, optimizing code, validating results, interpreting molecular data, and acknowledging limitations—apply broadly to materials science, drug design, protein folding, and future computational challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:** We calculated DNA volume (~3,266 Å³) and accessible volume (~31,950 Å³) using Monte Carlo simulation. The main lesson is that Monte Carlo provides powerful tools for molecular calculations, but effective use requires combining computational skills with chemistry, biology, and respect for molecular complexity.\n",

    "## Individual Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emad Omar Mohamed\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving from simple spheres to real DNA data was both challenging and rewarding. Implementing Monte Carlo functions (uniform sampling, point-in-sphere checks, volume estimation) and verifying them against theoretical values made the 1/√N convergence behavior tangible rather than abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we repeated similar code for each task. Refactoring into general functions that work for any number of spheres significantly improved our workflow. Next time, I'll prioritize code structure earlier rather than rushing through tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding van der Waals radii was initially difficult. Learning how atomic radii directly affect volume calculations—with V ∝ r³, small radius changes cause large volume changes—proved crucial. Careful file reading and unit conversion (picometers to Angstroms) were essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing in smaller steps would have helped. Large code blocks made debugging difficult, especially with nested loops checking 259 atoms. Despite challenges, I'm satisfied with our results and feel more confident about Monte Carlo methods and molecular modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hassan Nehad Adnan\n",
    "The project showed how the same Monte Carlo framework applies to different problems—from simple spheres to real DNA molecules. Topic 2 introduced random walks and their differences from uniform sampling. The vectorization speedup (10,000×!) demonstrated NumPy's power impressively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with real DNA data proved computationally expensive—checking each random point against 259 atoms required thinking about algorithmic efficiency beyond correctness. Time management was challenging; starting Topic 2 late meant rushing accessible volume calculations and nearly skipping verification tests. Better time distribution would help next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teamwork worked well. When stuck, others provided debugging help or fresh ideas. Emad caught numerical issues, Sture maintained organized code with clear variables, and I focused on plotting and interpreting molecular results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: The step-by-step progression from simple to complex was effective for learning. Providing expected DNA volume ranges or literature comparisons would help future groups validate results better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sture Odin Domingos Troli\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the math—why Monte Carlo error scales like 1/√N and how the Central Limit Theorem fits in—was hard at first, but empowering once it clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deriving V = (fraction_inside) × V_box was straightforward. Seeing it work on real DNA data was especially satisfying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean plots with good labels made convergence clear. As N grew, the volume estimates settled down, which confirmed the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging was tricky. The code sometimes ran without crashing but gave wrong volumes (like negative accessible volume or DNA bigger than the box). Adding assertions and sanity checks for intermediate steps—not just final results—was essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biology piece was tough with our limited chemistry background. Deciding if numbers were reasonabl (is 3,266 Å³ reasonable? what does 11% overlap mean?) needed references and group discussion. It showed why mixing disciplines matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We handled Topic 1 well, but Topic 2 was rushed. Next time, we should start the random walk and accessible volume parts earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions: The math level and pacing were good. The DNA example was engaging. Adding checkpoints or expected value ranges would help groups see if they’re on track sooner. Overall, this felt like real computational chemistry work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collective Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "As a group, we're proud of our accomplishments: building and testing Monte Carlo methods, verifying them against theory, applying them to real DNA data, and calculating both occupied and accessible volumes. We gained practical skills in Python for scientific computing, code optimization through vectorization, professional plotting, and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good teamwork requires clear communication, flexible roles, and patience when helping each other. This project needs better time planning—we can improve next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project connected abstract mathematics to real molecular science. The same Monte Carlo methods working for both simple spheres and DNA calculations demonstrated the power and generality of these tools, while reminding us that real molecules are more complex than simple sphere models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If we repeated this project, we would:**\n",
    "- Start earlier, especially on Topic 2\n",
    "- Write modular, reusable code from the beginning\n",
    "- Add systematic tests and validation checks\n",
    "- Plan time better across tasks, reserving adequate verification time\n",
    "- Try extensions like spatial indexing or different radius sets\n",
    "- Test with other molecules (proteins, RNA) to verify code generalizability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acknowledgments:** We thank the instructors for an engaging project. The mix of clear mathematical goals, real molecular data, logical task progression, and appropriate scope created an excellent learning experience. The balance between simple tasks and complex applications was well-designed, making the project accessible for students from different backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project better prepared us for computational chemistry, molecular modeling, and scientific programming. Understanding Monte Carlo methods, vectorization, and molecular representations through hands-on experience made concepts much clearer than reading alone would have achieved."
