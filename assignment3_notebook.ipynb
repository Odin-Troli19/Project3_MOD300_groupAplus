    "In this project, we used Monte Carlo simulations to find the volume of a DNA molecule. We first used the method on simple spheres, then added steps so it could also work for more complex molecules. For a sphere, we put random points in a 3D box and check if each point is inside or outside the sphere. The share of points inside tells us the sphere’s volume. We checked that the method works by working out π (pi) and comparing it to the known value.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we used the same method on DNA. We treated each atom as a sphere with a known position and a van der Waals radius from the periodic table. Our results show that Monte Carlo simulations can find volumes well when we use enough random points. We also used a random-walk method to measure the open space around the DNA. These results show that Monte Carlo methods are useful for tough shape problems in molecular biology. We also talk about how close our results are to the real answer, where errors might come from, and how we could make the method better in the future."

    "Understanding the mathematical foundations—on why Monte Carlo error follows 1/√N and how the Central Limit Theorem applies—was difficult but ultimately empowering. Deriving V = (fraction_inside) × V_box was straightforward, but seeing it work on real DNA was rewarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating clear plots with proper labels helped us understand convergence—watching volume estimates stabilize as N increased confirmed the method worked. Side-by-side comparison of DNA and accessible volumes was particularly insightful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging was sometimes frustrating. Code could run without errors but produce incorrect volumes (negative accessible volume or DNA larger than the box). Adding assertions and sanity checks to validate intermediate results, not just final outputs, proved essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding molecular biology concepts was challenging with limited chemistry background. Judging if values were realistic (is 3,266 Å³ reasonable? what does 11% overlap mean?) required references and group discussion, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "We handled Topic 1 well, but Topic 2 felt rushed. Next time, allocating more time to random walk implementation and starting accessible volume calculations earlier would improve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions: The math level and complexity progression were appropriate. The DNA application was engaging. Adding checkpoints or expected output ranges would help groups confirm they're on track earlier. Overall, this felt like authentic computational chemistry work.\n",

    "### Collective Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "As a group, we're proud of our accomplishments: building and testing Monte Carlo methods, verifying them against theory, applying them to real DNA data, and calculating both occupied and accessible volumes. We gained practical skills in Python for scientific computing, code optimization through vectorization, professional plotting, and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good teamwork requires clear communication, flexible roles, and patience when helping each other. This project needs better time planning—we can improve next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project connected abstract mathematics to real molecular science. The same Monte Carlo methods working for both simple spheres and DNA calculations demonstrated the power and generality of these tools, while reminding us that real molecules are more complex than simple sphere models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If we repeated this project, we would:**\n",
    "- Start earlier, especially on Topic 2\n",
    "- Write modular, reusable code from the beginning\n",
    "- Add systematic tests and validation checks\n",
    "- Plan time better across tasks, reserving adequate verification time\n",
    "- Try extensions like spatial indexing or different radius sets\n",
    "- Test with other molecules (proteins, RNA) to verify code generalizability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acknowledgments:** We thank the instructors for an engaging project. The mix of clear mathematical goals, real molecular data, logical task progression, and appropriate scope created an excellent learning experience. The balance between simple tasks and complex applications was well-designed, making the project accessible for students from different backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project better prepared us for computational chemistry, molecular modeling, and scientific programming. Understanding Monte Carlo methods, vectorization, and molecular representations through hands-on experience made concepts much clearer than reading alone would have achieved."
